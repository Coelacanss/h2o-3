/**
 * <hr/>
 * <h1>Cascade</h1>
 *
 * <p> Cascade is the next generation of the Rapids language. It is an
 * interpreted language with Lisp-like syntax. A Cascade program is first read
 * by the {@link CascadeParser} and converted into an Abstract Syntax Tree.
 * The root node of this AST is then executed, and its result is returned to
 * the user. Each {@link AstNode} will first evaluate its children nodes, and
 * thus the entire AST is recursively executed.
 *
 * <p> Within a single session execution is single-threaded. However operations
 * on large data frames are still parallelized across the entire cluster, thus
 * most time-consuming work is performed efficiently.
 *
 * <p> All {@code AstNode}s are executed within the context of some
 * {@link Scope}. A <i>scope</i> is essentially a namespace for variables
 * lookup. The scopes can be nested, with variables in the inner scope
 * shadowing variables from the outer scopes. Also, when a scope is exited,
 * then all variables that were defined within that scope will be automatically
 * garbage-collected. Each scope carries a reference to its parent scope, so
 * that if a variable cannot be found within the current scope, it will be
 * searched for in all parent scopes. Thus, scopes also form a tree, with root
 * being the "global scope". This global scope is kept in an instance of a
 * {@link CascadeSession} and persists across multiple REST API calls.
 *
 * <p> Executing an {@code AstNode} in Cascade produces a {@link Val}. Thus,
 * {@code Val} is Cascade's equivalent of {@code Object} in Java / Python.
 * Some {@code Val}s (notably {@link GhostFrame}s) may depend on external
 * resources (such as DKV) and thus require explicit deallocation when such
 * values are garbage-collected:
 * <ul>
 *   <li> If a {@code Val} is returned from a function, then it is the caller's
 *   responsibility to dispose of that value. Usually this happens within
 *   {@link AstApply}, and you don't need to do anything extra.
 *   <li> If a {@code Val} is stored in a variable, then it should be finalized
 *   when the variable is destroyed (either by going out of scope, or
 *   explicitly deleted by the user).
 *   <li> If in a function you create {@code Val}s but do not return them, you
 *   have to finalize them yourself. (This also applies to {@code Val}s that
 *   you mutate but do not return).
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p> For efficiency purposes, some {@code Val}s are considered mutable, while
 * others are read-only. All {@code Val}s are created in the mutable state, and
 * they become read-only when written to a variable. Mutating methods on
 * {@code Val}s are all written in such a way as to return modified copies of
 * themselves if they're in the read-only state; or otherwise change in-place
 * and return {@code this}. Certain functions may need to circumvent the
 * read-only protection and modify the {@code Val} anyways -- this should be
 * done only if the semantics of the function demands it, and when it is
 * clearly documented.
